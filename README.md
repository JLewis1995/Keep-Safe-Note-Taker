  ## Description

Keep-Safe Note Taker is a note taking application with a steamlined user interface. Upon page load you will find a nice landing page with a button to redirect you to the note page. You can enter a title and as many lines of text as you would like. Two buttons are on your top right, a floppy disk to save and a plus sign for a new note. You will also notice a list of saved notes on the left hand side. Additionally, you can delete a note at any time using the red trash can on the respective note.
